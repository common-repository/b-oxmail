Adds an AJAX based mail form to the sidebar.

== Description ==

This small widget will add a form to sidebar, which will allow visitors to send an e-mail/feedback directly from any page without visiting the contact page. The widget came into existence out of personal need, when some of the visitor on my blog where posting general queries in comments instead of mailing me.

Some Features :
	* AJAX based to prevent page reload.
	* CAPTCHA verification to prevent spams
	* Most of the Settings can be Changed from Admin Panel

If you find the widget useful, I would encourage you to send me a feedback for improvement or otherwise.

== Installation ==


1. Upload `boxmail` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the widget to sidebar from Appearance > Widgets
4. Settings can be changed at Settings > Boxmail Settings

This issue is fixed with 0.2.2 release. Now images are created on Fly without requiring background image.

For now a very basic feature "e-mail verification" is missing. It will be added in very next release. Captcha code is also to be improved.
